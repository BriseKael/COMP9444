# COMP9444 Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Assignment1: Digit Recognition
-----
Implementing a single layer network, a two layer network and a convolutional network to classify handwritten digits. We will work with the MNIST dataset, a common dataset used to evaluate Machine Learning models. (hw1)

Assignment2: Sentiment Classification
-----
Develop a classifier able to detect the sentiment of movie reviews. Sentiment classification is an active area of research. Aside from improving performance of systems like Siri and Cortana, sentiment analysis is very actively utilized in the finance industry, where sentiment is required for automated trading on news snippits and press releases. (hw2 & hw2sent)

Assignment3: Deep Reinforcement Learning
-----
Implement Q-Learning using a Neural Network as an approximator for the Q-function, with experience replay. (hw3)
